# Spatial Data Science across Languages workshops

The ‘Spatial Data Science across Languages’ (SDSL) workshops provide a space for bridging the 
communities and establishing cross-language interaction between developers and users.
SDSL seeks to bring together the communities from the common and emerging programming languages used
for data science such as R, Python and Julia, to discuss interoperability, methodological developments, 
and shared challenges such as interfacing upstream libraries (including GDAL, GEOS, and PROJ), packaging
and distributing software, and managing user and developer communities.

The SDSL workshops aim to identify commonalities and differences between spatial data science languages, 
to bridge language barriers and to bring the different communities together to discuss, cooperate, and
synchronise the development efforts.
